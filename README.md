# Tableau project :  Covid-19 Dashboard
Summary:
The external Covid-19 dashboard provides an overview of the municipal-level COVID-19 situation, we highlighted the key data and trends; as well as other pertinent information concerning the COVID-19 pandemic as of March 3rd 2022. Considering this is a report for external public audience, we limited the depth of analysing the data and let the audience to understand pandemic situation easier through the visualization.

Insights: 
1.Total cumulative cases
Total cumulative cases are 98,311. 
Cumulative death case:923
Cumulative hospitalized case: 19
Cumulative ICU case: 3


2. Case by location
Vanghan , Markham and Richmond Hills are the top 3 risk areas among the municipalities. So we recommend to avoid or reduce the chance to travel to these areas during this special time.

3. Daily reported case trend
From the Feburary 1st ,2020 to March 3rd 2022, there are total 3 high peaks of the covid-19 cases. After reaching to the highest peak point on December 31st, 2021. The number of reported daily case drop rapidly back around the average level within 2 months. 

4. Case by acquisition
There are more than half of the acquisition of Covid-19 infections are from the community spread. In an effort to stop the community spread, we encourage to stay at home and keep social distance  when venturing outside.

5.Case by age and gender
The kids and teenagers under 20s , plus the young adults around 20s are the two groups most likely to catch the virus. Since young people may have a false sense of confidence regarding their safety. We suspect that they may feel that mingling with others in large groups, attending parties, not wearing masks and ignoring community pandemic guidelines will not seriously endanger them.

Rationale for selecting variables: 
We chose to use analyze the COVID-19 situation from the perspectives of case quantity, location, daily case trend, transmission channels, age and genders.
And try to understand how these factors are impacting the infection cases. 

Rationale for selecting graphic or charts: 
Location charts: use map & bar chart to give both a general and detail visualizations for understanding how many cases are distributed in each municipality.
Daily case: use trendline & filter to easily understand the case trend during a specific time.
Acquisition: use the text table to look at numbers in a straight way.
Age & gender: use the stacked bar chart to distinguish the gender categories and distribute the gender categories into various age groups.

Rationale for including text content: 
In the dashboard, we try to use as less text content as we could, in order to simplify the visualization. However, the key data and label are kept for demonstrating the essential information to the public.

Other consideration for preparing the summary:
We excluded the null data in the graphics of map, location, case trend, acquisition, age and gender. However, the total cumulative cases numbers are calculated with all the available data. There is a record with an estimated date of onset on 2/19/1987. It might be a data entry error in the CVS. We keep use this record because we consider it still can be regarded as a valid reported case.
